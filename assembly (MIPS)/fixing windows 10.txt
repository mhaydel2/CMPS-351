I have the Windows 10 Home Version 21H2.Windows Logo Key + R > wsreset.exe = nothing happens after a minute
Windows Logo Key + R > wsreset.exe = nothing happens after a minute
Trying to run SFC and DISM to check for any system errors and corrupted files:
"Windows Resource Protection found corrupt files and successfully repaired them.
For online repairs, details are included in the CBS log file located at
windir\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For example C:\Windows\Logs\CBS\CBS.log. For offline
repairs, details are included in the log file provided by the /OFFLOGFILE flag."
Restarted and Windows Store still does not open and through Settings > Apps & Features > Microsoft Store > Reset, it still takes a long time.
